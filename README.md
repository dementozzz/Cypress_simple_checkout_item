# Portfolio - Simple Checkout Item

This GitHub repository serves as a showcase of my expertise in software testing and quality assurance. Using a fictitious website as the basis, I've developed a comprehensive software testing project powered by Cypress to demonstrate my capabilities.

# Installation

Open the project using Visual Studio Code, click Terminal > New Terminal, and then run the following command

```
npm install

# How to run

You can run the tests in two ways. Choose the one that suits your workflow:

## Interactive Mode
To run Cypress in interactive mode and view the test execution in the Cypress Test Runner, use the following command:

```
npx cypress open
```

## Headless Mode
To run Cypress tests in headless mode, which is suitable for automated testing and CI/CD pipelines, use the following command:

```
npx cypress run
```
